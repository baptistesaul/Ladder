# ðŸªœ â€¢ Ladder

---

**Ladder** is a full-featured Paper plugin foundation designed to streamline the development of **UHC** (Ultra Hardcore) Minecraft games (1.8).
It provides a modular and extensible API for developers looking to build their own custom scenarios, rules, or game logic on top of a reliable UHC engine.

The plugin runs **directly on the server**, and developers simply need to declare a dependency in their **plugin.yml** to use its API.
No need to reinvent the wheel for player management, timers, borders, or game lifecycle: Ladder handles it all.

### Key features:
