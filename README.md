# ðŸªœ â€¢ Ladder

---

**Ladder** is a full-featured Paper plugin foundation designed to streamline the development of **World** Minecraft games (1.8).
It provides a modular and extensible API for developers looking to build their own custom scenarios, rules, or game logic on top of a reliable UHC engine.

The plugin runs **directly on the server**, and developers simply need to declare a dependency in their **plugin.yml** to use its API.
No need to reinvent the wheel for player management, timers, borders, or game lifecycle: Ladder handles it all.

### Key features:
- Dependency injection with a custom system.
- Internalization support for multiple languages.

### License

This project is licensed under the **LGPL v3**, allowing free use and modification.
Any modification to the original source must be shared under the same terms.

### Contributing

The **Ladder** project is open to contributions.

If youâ€™re a Java developer interested in building features around **World** gameplay, feel free to fork the repository, 
and you can also contact me to discuss, propose ideas, or contribute code.

ðŸ‘‰ All forms of contribution are welcome: bug fixes, performance improvements, new modules, and more.
